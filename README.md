# Object-detection_model
The goal of this project is to develop an object detection model using the KITTI dataset, sourced from TensorFlow Datasets. This project will leverage Python and the TensorFlow library to build, train, and evaluate the model, focusing on detecting various objects in urban street scenes as captured in the KITTI dataset using transfer learning.
